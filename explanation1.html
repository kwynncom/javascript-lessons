for humans to read.  Every software language (that I've ever seen) has some way to make comments.

All of the HTML above this point is boilerplate that is necessary for HTML5 compliance (later lesson) and just a bit to make Google Search happier.

/* This is where things get fun.  JavaScript and any other language gives you lots of pre-built capabilities such as "window" below.  
 * The gory details are at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window
 * For our simple purposes, "window" is a variable (more later) / object (later).  window is magically available to JavaScript, as far as you're concerned
 * for now.  It represents the window in which this script will run.  
 * 
 * Window has a whole bunch of "methods."  One of which is onload.  You can consider that to be magic for now. 
 * 
 * JavaScript has a "magic" feature such that you can tell the browser what to do when the whole page has loaded.  
 * 
 * The "what to do" is whatever is on the right side of the = 
 * 
 * Generally speaking, code runs from top to bottom. The following partially runs before the page is loaded simply because the script tag is not at the 
 * end of the page.  Before the page loads completely, the onload function is defined but NOT run because the definition of "onload" is don't run until 
 * the page is loaded.  
 * 
 * "function" is a JavaScript keyword which means that it is not arbitrary.  "function" is a keyword in many languages.
 * 
 * Again, generally speaking, code runs from top to bottom.  A function, however, does not run until it is "called" from other code.  In this case, 
 * they call is hidden from you.  The "rules" are that the window will call whatever was assigned to onload when the page loads.  When the page loads, 
 * the code inside the function runs.
 * 
 * The () { } are all needed, too.  They are "tokens" in JavaScript and many other languages.  They make up the syntax of the language.  All code must follow 
 * the syntax or it won't work.  
 * 
 * I'll continue within the function.

    window.onload = function() {
       
       /* Like window, console is another magic variable / object.  It has a method "log" which will display to the browser console.  When you run 
        * Control-Shift-I in some desktop browsers (Firefox and Chrome, for two), you'll see the "console" where this will display. 
		* 
		* You can use console logs to help debug / trace your code, and it is sometimes useful for that, but I recommend the Chrome / Firefox / other 
		* debuggers over using console.log.  With that said, I use console.log fairly often.  
		* */
                  
        console.log('hello world - written to console');
		
		/* 
		 * The "const" (constant) keyword below is one of 3 keywords that tell JavaScript that we are about to name and define a variable--a variable in the 
		 * general sense.  In this case "const" means that once we assign / create / name the variable, it cannot change, so it's technically a constant and 
		 * not a variable, but that's a longer story for later.  For our immeidate purposes, it's a constant in the specific sense and a variable in the general 
		 * sense.  
		 * 
		 * I name the variable below "element" because it will refer to an HTML element.  
		 * 
		 * JavaScript and any other code, generally speaking, executes top to bottom.  Individual lines tend to execute right to left, but this can get 
		 * complicated.  It goes to a language's "order of operations" just like in math--exponents before multiplication before addition.  Below is an 
		 * assignment statement indicated by '='.  In this case, the '=' should be read as "the right side is assigned to the left variable."  The '=' is an 
		 * assignment operator.  It is NOT a logical equals.  We'll come to "equals" later.  The assignment operator can mean equals in the sense that when 
		 * the operation is done, element equals what's on the right.  
		 * 
		 * document is yet another magic object.  There really aren't all that many.  window, document, and console are 3 big ones.  Also, they only have a 
		 * relatively small number of properties / functions / methods that people often use.  "log" is a function or method in that it performs an action.  
		 * We haven't seen properties in this example, not quite yet.  In a moment.
		 * 
		 * document is to some degree a subset of window.  Actually, it might be precisley a subset.  document refers to the specific HTML document--in this 
		 * case, this file.  More precisely, it refers to this file once it is executed or rendered by the browser.  It refers to the "living" / active 
		 * objects that this source code creates.  (All source code, when run, creates and executes variables and logic.  That's the point.)
		 * 
		 * window is somewhat larger in that it gives access to some of the information around the document such as the URL.  
		 * 
		 * Note that in the HTML "<body>," not far below, there is a div element with a long id.  document.getElementById() is a function / method that 
		 * gives you access to the element with the id in question.  window and document give you tools to to make the page "alive" / programmable in real time, 
		 * and interactive with the user.
		 * 
		 * So, when the next line is done, element is a variable / object type of variable that represents the given div element.  
		 * 
		 * Otherwise put, document.getElementById() "returns" an object that represents and gives access to that div.  
		 * 
		 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById
		 * 
		 * Return value is an "Element" object

		/* The "Element" object, in this case elementArb... has properties including innerHTML.  (I don't think I've ever quite learned "inner" and "outer"
		 * HTML.)  For now all we need to know is that it's the stuff contained within in the "div" tags, just like "Press Control - U..." is contined in the 
		 * next div.  
		 * 
		 * So, assign the variable, and you have your "hello world" in that JavaScript is communicating with the world.
